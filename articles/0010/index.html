<h1>An Introduction to Regular Expressions</h1>
<p id="articlehead">An introduction to the fundamentals of regular
expressions and how to use them in a number of languages and
environments.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A decent knowledge of regular expressions
(sometimes known as regexps or REs) is a fundamental skill that any
buildmeister should acquire. Regular expressions are a language subset
(they are common to many different programming and scripting languages)
that allow you to specify a set of rules for a particular text pattern
that you want to match. For example, searching through a source code
file to find all the classes that being with the string
&quot;admin&quot;. In this article we will introduce the different
aspects of the regular expression language, how you can make use of it,
and how different languages support it.</p>
<h2>The basics</h2>
<p>The simplest form of a regular expression is one
that searches for a particular text string without any special
characters, thus:</p>
<div id="codeoutput">xxx</div>
<p>will find all lines of a file or part of a string
that contain three letters <b>x</b> in succession at any point. Now
obviously, this is a great start but is probably rare that we know the
exact sequence of characters that we wish to match or more likely we
want to only match a sequence of characters at specific points in a
file. For example, if we wanted to match the above string but only if it
was at the beginning of a line we&nbsp; could use the special character
<b>^ </b>as follows:</p>
<div id="codeoutput">^xxx</div>
<p>Likewise you can use the<b> $ </b>character to only match the
string if it appears only at the end of a line.</p>
<h2>Wild Cards</h2>
<p>Regular expressions can include a number of wild
card symbols. A period can be used to specify exactly one arbitrary
character, for example:</p>
<div id="codeoutput">x.</div>
<p>will find all strings containing the letter <b>x</b>
followed by any character, i.e. <b>xa</b>, <b>xb</b>, <b>xc</b> and so
on. Asterisks can be used to specify the repetition of an expression
zero or more times, for example:</p>
<div id="codeoutput">abx*</div>
<p>will find all strings containing the letters <b>ab</b>
followed by zero or more <b>x</b>'s, i.e. <b>ab</b>, <b>abx</b>, <b>abxxxx</b>
and so on. Similarly the <b>+ </b>sign can be used to specify the
repetition of a string but at least one time, for example:</p>
<div id="codeoutput">abx+</div>
<p>will find all strings containing the letters <b>ab</b>
followed by one or more <b>x</b>'s, i.e. <b>abx</b>, <b>abxx</b> and so
on.</p>
<p>Sets of characters can be specified by enclosing the characters
in square brackets, for example:</p>
<div id="codeoutput">x[ab]</div>
<p>will find the strings <b>xa</b> or <b>xb</b>. Ranges of
characters can be specified using the - character, for example:</p>
<div id="codeoutput">x[a-c]</div>
<p>will find the strings <b>xa,</b> <b>xb</b> or <b>xc</b>.
You can also use the <b>^</b> character to specify the characters that
do not belong to the set, for example:</p>
<div id="codeoutput">x[^a-b]</div>
<p>will not match either <b>xa</b> or <b>xb</b> but
<b>xc</b>, <b>xd</b> and so on. Finally, you can use the <b>|</b>
character to specify an OR relationship for regular expressions, for
example:</p>
<div id="codeoutput">xa|xb</div>
<p>will find the strings <b>xa</b> or <b>xb</b>. If
you want to match any of these characters without using it's special
meaning then you can escape it using the <b>\ </b>character.</p>
<h2>Pattern Symbols</h2>
<p>The regular expression language has a number of
pre-defined symbols that match sets or groupings of characters, for
example the <b>\d</b> symbol will match any (number) digit, conversely
the <b>\D</b> symbol will match any non (number) digit. The <b>\w</b>
symbol will match any word character consisting of letters, numbers or
the underscore character (which is equivalent to the set [a-zA-z_0-9])
and <b>\W </b>will match any non word character. Finally, the <b>\s</b>
symbol will match any whitespace character (tabs, spaces, new-lines and
so on] whilst<b> \S</b> will match any non whitespace character. A
number of whitespace characters can also be matched explictly, for
example to match a tab, you can use <b>\t</b>, a newline <b>\n</b> and a
carriage return <b>\r</b>.</p>

<h2>Some Examples</h2>
<p>In Perl you can specify
regular expressions between<b> / </b>delimiters (you can change the
delimiter if you wish), and you add modifiers after the closing <b>/</b>.
For example, to carry out a global search and replace of the pattern <b>xxx</b>
with <b>yyy </b>you could use the expression:</p>
<div id="codeoutput">s/xxx/yyy/g</div>
<p>to match the contents
of a variable to a regular expression, you can use the <b>=~</b>
operator as in the following code:</span></p>
<div id="codeoutput">$str
= &quot;Hello World&quot;;<br />
$str =~ s/Hello/Goodbye/;<br />
print $str;<br />
<b>Goodbye World</b></div>
<p>Java2 version 1.4 and
onwards includes the regular expression class java.util.regex. In Java
you specify a regular expression as a String, which must first be
compiled into an instance of the class Pattern. The resulting pattern
can then be used to create a Matcher object that can match arbitrary
character sequences against the regular expression. For example:</p>
<pre name="code" class="java">
Pattern p = Pattern.compile(&quot;Hello&quot;);
Matcher m = p.matcher(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
myMatcher.replaceAll(&quot;subject&quot;,&quot;replacement&quot;)
boolean b = m.matches();
</pre>
<p>Visual Basic, C++ and
C# amongst other languages can make use of the shared regular expression
library provided under Microsoft's .NET framework.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This article was intended as an introduction to
using regular expressions. The table below summarises the language.
There is more to the regular expression language and in fact complete
books have been written on the subject, and I therefore encourage you to
view the references listed below in more detail.</p>
