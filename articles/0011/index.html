			<h2 align="left">The Perl Command line to the Rescue</h2>
			<p align="justify"><i>There are a few essential capabilities
			of the Perl command line that could potentially save your hours of
			work; this article explains how.</i></p>
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p align="justify">Perl is currently one of the most widely used
			scripting languages. It is relatively straightforward to learn and
			great for creating basic but functional scripts. However, when
			needed, Perl also has the power and capabilities of a full blown
			procedural or object oriented language. As a tool, Perl can be of
			great use to build or release engineers. For example, you could write
			Perl scripts to extract software deliveries into specific directory
			structures, scripts to wrap processes around version control tools or
			scripts to extract text patterns for the automatic creation of
			release notes. Perl is particularly adept at just-in-time scripting,
			that is, one-shot scripts (usually initiated via the command line) to
			execute what might normally be considerable, time-consuming tasks. In
			the remainder of this article we will look at how we can invoke Perl
			from the command line and some examples of how to leverage its
			capabilities to achieve just that.</p>
			<h3>Standard Command Execution</h3>
			<p align="justify">To execute standard Perl commands from the
			command line, you can use the <b>-e</b> option followed by the line
			or lines of script that you wish to execute. For example, a rather
			straightforward command to print out some text would be:</p>
			<pre
				style="margin-left: 18pt; color: gray; font-family: Courier New;"><b>&gt;</b>perl -e &quot;print 'command line test';&quot;<br />
            <b>command line test</b></pre>
			<p align="justify">Since the <b>-e</b> option is treated as if it
			ends with a newline, multiple <b>-e</b> options may be used. A more
			useful example to illustrate this, that displays the last accessed
			time of the file <i>log.txt</i> would be as follows:</p>
			<pre
				style="margin-left: 18pt; color: gray; font-family: Courier New;">&gt;perl -e &quot;print \&quot;Last accessed time of log.txt:\n\&quot;;&quot; \<br />
            -e &quot;print scalar localtime((stat(\&quot;log.txt\&quot;))[9]);&quot;<br />
            <b>Last accessed time of log.txt:<br />
            Sun Sep 12 18:40:20 2004</b></pre>
			<p align="justify">Note here, the use of escaped quotes (<b>\&quot;</b>),
			which you can use when you want to use the string quote character
			within an existing string.</p>
			<h3>implicit Loops</h3>
			<p align="justify">Executing lines of Perl from the command line
			is one thing, probably of more use however, is Perl's ability to
			generate implicit loops. This feature is invoked by specifying either
			the <b>-n </b>or <b>-p</b> option, upon which Perl will automatically
			add loops around the code that you specify via the <b>-e</b>
			parameter discussed above. This feature can be extremely useful for
			parsing and processing files one line at a time - a common activity
			for build or release engineers. In practice, what this means is that
			when you specify the following code:</p>
			<pre
				style="margin-left: 18pt; color: gray; font-family: Courier New;">&gt;perl -n -e &quot;<i>your code</i>&quot; file1</pre>
			<p>Perl will expand it to:</p>
			<pre
				style="margin-left: 18pt; color: gray; font-family: Courier New;">LINE:<br />
            while (&lt;&gt;) {<br />
            <i>your code</i>             }</pre>
			<p align="justify">which will basically cause Perl to iterate
			over every line of <i>file1</i> executing &quot;<i>your code</i>&quot;.
			As an example, let us suppose that we had the following source code
			file <font face="Courier New">HelloWorld.java</font>:</p>
			<pre
				style="margin-left: 18pt; color: gray; font-family: Courier New;">class HelloWorld {<br />
            public static void main (String args[]) {<br />
            System.out.print(&quot;Hello World &quot;);<br />
            }<br />
            }</pre>
			<p align="justify">and that we wanted to extract all the class
			names for a summary report. We could use the following command:</p>
			<pre
				style="margin-left: 18pt; color: gray; font-family: Courier New;">&gt;perl -n -e &quot;if (/class/) { print $_ }&quot; HelloWorld.java<br />
            <b>class HelloWorld {</b></pre>
			<p align="justify">Here we are using <b>$_</b> string, which in
			Perl refers to the current line. In this example, you might also want
			to do a bit of formatting at the same time, for example removing the
			trailing curly bracket (<b>{</b>) with the following code:</p>
			<pre
				style="margin-left: 18pt; color: gray; font-family: Courier New;">&gt;perl -n -e &quot;if (/class/) { <b>s/{//</b>; print $_ }&quot; HelloWorld.java<br />
            <b>class HelloWorld</b></pre>
			<p align="justify">The <b>-p</b> option is similar to the <b>-n</b>
			option, except that it always prints the contents of <b><code>$_</code></b>
			each time around the loop. Here is an example to display our source
			code but automatically line numbered:</p>
			<pre
				style="margin-left: 18pt; color: gray; font-family: Courier New;">&gt;perl -p -e &quot;print \&quot;$.:\t\&quot;&quot; HelloWorld.java<br />
            <b>1:    class HelloWorld {<br />
            2:    public static void main (String args[]) {<br />
            3:          System.out.print(&quot;Hello World &quot;);<br />
            4:            }<br />
            5:    }</b></pre>
			<p align="justify">If you need to have processing carried out
			either before or after the main code loop, you can also use a <b><code>BEGIN</code></b>
			or <b><code>END</code></b> block. Using this, we could improve our
			class listing example above to print out the total number of classes
			at the end as follows:</p>
			<pre
				style="margin-left: 18pt; color: gray; font-family: Courier New;">&gt;perl -n -e &quot;END { print \&quot;Total classes: $i\&quot; } \<br />
            if (/Data/) { $i++; s/{//; print $_ }&quot; HelloWorld.java<br />
            <b>class HelloWorld<br />
            Total classes: 1</b></pre>
			<h3>In place Editing</h3>
			<p align="justify">One further ability worth mentioning is
			in-place editing, this allows you to make text translations
			(in-place) on a file. For example, referring to our <font
				face="Courier New">HelloWorld.java</font> code example above, if we
			wanted to replace all occurrences of <font face="Courier New">Hello</font>
			with <font face="Courier New">Goodbye</font> then we could use the <b>-i</b>
			option as follows:</p>
			<pre
				style="margin-left: 18pt; color: gray; font-family: Courier New;">&gt;perl -i -pe &quot;s/Hello/Goodbye/g;&quot; HelloWorld.java</pre>
			<p align="justify">Essentially what Perl is doing here is
			renaming the input file, then reading from this renamed version
			(whilst doing the translation) and writing to a new file with the
			original name. If <b><code>-i</code></b> is given a string argument,
			then that string is appended to the name of the original version of
			the file. If instead we specified the following:</p>
			<pre
				style="margin-left: 18pt; color: gray; font-family: Courier New;">&gt;perl -i<i>.bak</i> -pe &quot;s/Hello/Goodbye/g;&quot; HelloWorld.java</pre>
			<p align="justify">then we would end up with the file <font
				face="Courier New">HelloWorld.java.bak</font> (with the contents of
			our original file) in the current directory. This feature is probably
			suitable for those with a nervous disposition or just beginning with
			their Perl skills.</p>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p align="justify">This article was intended as an introduction
			to using the Perl command line and how it can help you simplify and
			automate your build and release engineering tasks. We concentrated
			here on the most widely used command line options, however there are
			a few more, so I encourage you to check out the references below.</p>
