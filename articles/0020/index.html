			<h2>Managing Java dependencies with Apache Ant and Ivy</h2>
			<p align="justify" style="font-style: italic;">The world of Java
			is one of open-source, common components and rapid, evolving change.
			However, one of the caveats of such a model is the time spent in
			managing library dependencies. In this article I discuss in more
			detail the nature of this problem and how a specific tool: <a
				href="http://jayasoft.org/ivy">Ivy</a> - can be used to help you
			solve this problem.</p>
			<h3>The Java dependency management problem</h3>
			<p align="justify">If you took a typical enterprise Java
			application and decomposed it down into the libraries that were
			developed or reused to implement it, you could easily find upwards of
			100 different libraries (or .j<span style="font-style: italic;">ar</span>
			files). A number of these libraries might be open source
			implementations, such as the Jakarta <a
				href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/">commons</a> libraries,
			others might be commercial business components that you have sourced
			from a third party. However, since many commercial components also
			make extensive&nbsp;use of open source components themselves (and why
			wouldn't they!), you can quite easily find yourself with duplicate
			sets of libraries&nbsp;at&nbsp;different versions levels!</p>
			<p align="justify">When you are developing your own common
			libraries, you will obviously also be creating multiple versions of
			them and will probably need to support different versions&nbsp;for
			different projects, or for projects in different
			phases.&nbsp;Following on from this, your library dependencies might
			have dependencies on other libraries themselves (so called <span
				style="font-weight: bold;">transitive dependencies</span>), you will
			also need to manage and capture this kind of metadata too.</p>
			<p align="justify">The typical ways that organizations solve this
			problem are to create a shared&nbsp;repository of libraries -
			sometimes in version control system, sometimes not. This approach can
			work but requires a significant amount of administration to keep it
			up to date. This is especially true for&nbsp;transitive dependencies
			where you would need to somehow store&nbsp;their associative metadata
			alongside the components. Alternately you would need to create a
			significant amount of baselines in your version control system to
			refer to a compatible (and collective set) of libraries.</p>
			<p align="justify">Fortunately, there are now a number of Java
			tools that can help you resolve this problem. These include <a
				href="http://www.buildmeister.com/modules/content/index.php?id=14">Apache
			Maven</a> (which is a complete replacement for <a
				href="http://www.buildmeister.com/modules/content/index.php?id=13">Apache
			Ant</a>) or the tool that is the subject of this article: <a
				href="http://jayasoft.org/ivy">Ivy</a> - which works with your
			existing Apache Ant build scripts.</p>
			<h3>Getting started with Ivy<span
				style="font-family: monospace;"></span></h3>
			<p align="justify">Getting Ivy up and running with your existing
			Apache Ant base build process is relatively straightforward, and can
			be carried out as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Download the Ivy binary distribution from <a
					href="http://jayasoft.org/ivy/download">http://jayasoft.org/ivy/download</a>
				</li>
				<li>Extract the downloaded archive somewhere on your hard disk.
				</li>
				<li>Copy the extracted .<span style="font-style: italic;">jar</span>
				file, i.e. <span style="font-family: monospace;">ivy-1.3-RC3.jar</span><span
					style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>to your Ant <span
					style="font-family: monospace;">lib</span><span
					style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>directory (this ensures that it
				will be on your <span style="font-style: italic;">classpath</span>).
				</li>
				<li>Create an <span style="font-family: monospace;">ivy.xml</span>
				file (alongside your Ant <span style="font-family: monospace;">build.xml</span>
				file) to specify your project's library dependencies</li>
				<li>Configure your Ant <span style="font-family: monospace;">build.xml</span>
				file to resolve these dependencies and build against them.</li>
			</ul>
			<p align="justify">Let's walk through the last two steps in a bit
			more detail. The <span style="font-family: monospace;">ivy.xml</span>
			file lists the library dependencies which the project requires to be
			accessible so that it can build against them,&nbsp;as in the
			following:</p>
			<p
				style="margin-left: 40px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: monospace;">&lt;ivy-module
			version=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;<br />
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;info organisation=&quot;jayasoft&quot;
			module=&quot;ivytest&quot; /&gt; <br />
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;dependencies&gt;<br />
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;dependency org=&quot;apache&quot;
			name=&quot;commons-lang&quot; rev=&quot;2.1&quot; /&gt;&nbsp;<br />
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;<span class="xmlverb-element-name">dependency</span>
			<span class="xmlverb-attr-name">org</span>=&quot;<span
				class="xmlverb-attr-content">apache</span>&quot; <span
				class="xmlverb-attr-name">name</span>=&quot;<span
				class="xmlverb-attr-content">commons-cli</span>&quot; <span
				class="xmlverb-attr-name">rev</span>=&quot;<span
				class="xmlverb-attr-content">1.0</span>&quot; /&gt;<br />
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;dependency
			org=&quot;buildmeister&quot; name=&quot;RatlBankModel&quot;
			rev=&quot;1.001&quot;/&gt;<br />
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/dependencies&gt;<br />
			&lt;/ivy-module&gt;</p>
			<p align="justify">This particular example lists three
			dependencies, two of which are Apache commons libraries (<span
				style="font-style: italic;">commons-lan</span>g and <span
				style="font-style: italic;">commons-cli</span>) and one of which is
			an internally produced library (<span style="font-style: italic;">RatlBankModel</span>).
			One of the best things about Ivy is that it supports transitive
			dependencies. In this example there is some extra metadata that has
			been placed in the ivy repository for the <span
				style="font-style: italic;">commons-cli</span> library that says
			that it depends on <span style="font-style: italic;">commons-logging</span>
			too, so this library will be additionally downloaded at resolve time.</p>
			<p align="justify">To configure your Ant <span
				style="font-family: monospace;">build.xml</span> file to resolve and
			build against these dependencies you would include the following:</p>
			<blockquote
				style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: monospace;">&lt;project
			<span style="font-weight: bold;">xmlns:ivy=&quot;antlib:fr.jayasoft.ivy.ant&quot;</span>
			name=&quot;ivytest&quot; default=&quot;compile&quot;&gt;<br />
			&nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br />
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;property name=&quot;dir.src&quot;
			value=&quot;src&quot;/&gt;<br />
			<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;property
			name=&quot;dir.lib&quot; value=&quot;lib&quot;/&gt;</span><br />
			<br />
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;!-- define a classpath for use throughout the file
			--&gt;<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;path id=&quot;project.classpath&quot;&gt;<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;!-- include local libraries
			--&gt;<br />
			<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;fileset dir=&quot;${dir.lib}&quot;/&gt;</span><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/path&gt;<br />
			<br />
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;target name=&quot;resolve&quot;
			description=&quot;retrieve dependencies with ivy&quot;&gt;<br />
			&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; &nbsp;
			&lt;ivy:retrieve/&gt;</span> <br />
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/target&gt;<br />
			&nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br />
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;target name=&quot;compile&quot;
			depends=&quot;resolve&quot;&gt;<br />
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;javac&gt;<br />
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;src
			path=&quot;${dir.src}&quot;/&gt; <br />
			<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;classpath refid=&quot;project.classpath&quot;/&gt;
			</span><br />
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/javac&gt;<br />
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/target&gt;<br />
			&nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br />
			&lt;/project&gt;</blockquote>
			<p align="justify">As you can see the first line of this file
			declares the namespace for the Ivy tasks that the build file will
			include, one of Ivy tasks is the <span style="font-style: italic;">retrieve</span>
			task which scans your Ivy repositories to resolve the dependencies.
			By default any libraries are resolved to a local cache first and then
			retrieved (copied) to the <span style="font-family: monospace;">lib</span>
			directory inside the current working directory. Consequently the
			project's <span style="font-style: italic;">classpath</span> uses
			this fact to define the set of files that this project should build
			against. The actual resolution process is quite seamless with Ivy;
			it's conflict manager will download libraries as you need them, evict
			those that are no longer required and can also be configured to
			execute operations such as download the libraries that are latest in
			time or latest in revision number.</p>
			<h3>Configuring Ivy resolvers</h3>
			<p align="justify">Ivy can be configured to look for (and
			resolve) libraries in a number of locations, either on the Internet
			at the <a href="http://ivyrep.jayasoft.org/">ivyrep</a> site (its
			default) or the Apache Maven <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/maven/">ibiblio</a>
			site. These sites contain a vast collection of common libraries, the
			advantage of the <span style="font-style: italic;">ivyrep</span> site
			is that the metadata for resolving transitive dependencies is also
			stored there. If you don't have an Internet connection or want to
			create your own repository, Ivy can also be configured to look at a
			shared or user specific repository. To customize this configuration
			you create an <span style="font-family: monospace;">ivyconf.xml</span>
			file as in the following:</p>
			<blockquote
				style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: monospace;">&lt;ivyconf&gt;<br />
			&nbsp; &lt;conf defaultResolver=&quot;buildmeister&quot;/&gt;<br />
			&nbsp; &lt;resolvers&gt;<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;chain name=&quot;buildmeister&quot;&gt;<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;filesystem
			name=&quot;local&quot;&gt;<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;artifact
			pattern=&quot;${ivy.conf.dir}/artifacts/[artifact]-[revision].[ext]&quot;
			/&gt;<br />
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="xmlverb-text"></span>&lt;<span
				class="xmlverb-element-name">ivy</span> <span
				class="xmlverb-attr-name">pattern</span>=&quot;<span
				class="xmlverb-attr-content">${</span>ivy.conf.dir<span
				class="xmlverb-attr-content">}/ivy/[module]-[revision].xml</span>&quot;
			/&gt;<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/filesystem&gt;<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code><span
				class="synIdentifier">&lt;ivyrep name=&quot;public&quot;/&gt;</span><span
				class="synIdentifier"></span></code><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/chain&gt;<br />
			&nbsp; &lt;/resolvers&gt;<br />
			&lt;/ivyconf&gt;</blockquote>
			<p align="justify">This example chains together two resolvers,
			the first resolver looks locally for any revisions of libraries in
			the <span style="font-family: monospace;">artifacts</span> directory
			in the same directory as the <span style="font-family: monospace;">ivyconf.xml</span>
			file. If the library cannot be found then a second resolver is used
			to look on <span style="font-style: italic;">ivyrep.</span> To
			specify the location of this <span style="font-family: monospace;">ivyconf.xml</span>
			file in your build script you would specify the <span
				style="font-family: monospace;">ivy.conf.dir</span> property as
			follows:</p>
			<blockquote
				style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: monospace;">
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;property
			name=&quot;dir.lib&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			value=&quot;lib&quot;/&gt;<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;property
			name=&quot;ivy.conf.dir&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			value=&quot;../components/&quot;/&gt;</span><br />
			&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;!-- define a classpath for use throughout the
			file --&gt;<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;path id=&quot;project.classpath&quot;&gt;<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;!-- include local libraries
			--&gt;<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;fileset
			dir=&quot;${dir.lib}&quot;/&gt;<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/path&gt;</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p align="justify">In this example the <span
				style="font-family: monospace;">ivy.conf.dir</span> property is
			specified to look at the <span style="font-family: monospace;">components</span>
			directory that is at the same level in the directory hierarchy as the
			project's working directory. Inside this <span
				style="font-family: monospace;">component</span> directory is where
			the <span style="font-family: monospace;">ivyconf.xml</span> file
			resides and the <span style="font-family: monospace;">artifacts</span>
			and <span style="font-family: monospace;">ivy</span> directory.</p>
			<h3>Publishing libraries using Ivy</h3>
			<p align="justify">To make use of Ivy for your own internally
			developed libraries, you can use Ivy's <span
				style="font-style: italic;">publish</span> task in your <span
				style="font-family: monospace;">build.xml</span> file as follows:</p>
			<blockquote
				style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: monospace;">&lt;target
			name=&quot;publish&quot; depends=&quot;jar&quot;&gt;<br />
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;property name=&quot;revision&quot;
			value=&quot;${build.number}&quot;/&gt; <br />
			&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;ivy:publish
			artifactspattern=&quot;${dir.build}/[artifact].[ext]&quot; </span><br
				style="font-weight: bold;" />
			<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			resolver=&quot;buildmeister&quot; pubrevision=&quot;${revision}&quot;
			status=&quot;release&quot;/&gt; </span><br style="font-weight: bold;" />
			<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>&lt;echo
			message=&quot;project ${ant.project.name} released with version
			${revision}&quot;/&gt; <br />
			&lt;/target&gt;</blockquote>
			<p align="justify">This example will publish any libraries built
			in the directory specified by the <span
				style="font-family: monospace;">dir.build</span> property (as well
			as any corresponding ivy files), for example <span
				style="font-family: monospace;">RatlBankModel.jar</span> and <span
				style="font-family: monospace;">RatlBankModel.xml</span>. The
			location to publish to is specified by the resolver, in this case it
			is the &quot;<span style="font-style: italic;">buildmeister</span>&quot;
			resolver which refers to the shared directory location containing the
			organizations libraries -&nbsp; as described in the previous section.
			To generate a unique version number for the library you can use Ant's
			<a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/CoreTasks/buildnumber.html">buildnumber</a>
			task to automatically increment the version number (as referenced by
			the <span style="font-family: monospace;">build.number</span>
			property).</p>
			<h3>Other capabilities and integrations</h3>
			<p align="justify">The scenarios discussed above, only cover a
			subset of the capabilities&nbsp;that Ivy possesses. There are more
			wide ranging capabilties that can be used to support the majority of
			projects. One that is certainly worth mentioning specifically is the
			graphical dependency reports that the tool can automatically create -
			as in the following:</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/images/ivy-report.jpg"
				target="_blank"><img
				style="border: 0px solid; width: 299px; height: 212px;"
				alt="Ivy Report" src="/images/ivy-report-small.jpg" /></a></p>
			<p align="justify">More examples of reports such as these can be
			seen on the Ivy <a href="http://jayasoft.org/ivy/features">website</a>.</p>
			<p align="justify">Ivy also integrates well with a number of
			popular open source tools. Obviously, it integrates seamlessly with
			Apache Ant, however there is also a plugin for integrating Ivy into
			the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> development
			environment (or any commercial tools based on it). This integration
			gives you an editor for creating Ivy files as well as a really useful
			capability for resolving libraries and adding the resultant set of
			libraries&nbsp; to your Eclipse project's buildpath - as illustrated
			in the following:</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><img
				style="width: 299px; height: 359px;" alt="Eclipse Integration"
				src="/images/ivy-eclipse.jpg" /></p>
			<p align="justify">Finally, Ivy can also integrate with <a
				href="http://www.buildmeister.com/modules/content/index.php?id=9">CruiseControl</a>
			&nbsp;- the popular open source Continuous Integration toolkit. This
			allows you to automate the building of interdependent projects for
			Continous Integration.</p>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p align="justify">In summary, Ivy is an extremely powerful
			addition to Apache Ant&nbsp;supporting dependency management. It is
			quick and very straightforward to get up and running with (in a
			matter of a few minutes) but is also powerful enough to ensure that
			it is usable across large&nbsp;and multiple projects. Using Ant and
			Ivy together you can do away with managing libraries manually in a
			shared directory or in your version control system (although you
			still might want to version control significant releases for
			deployment purposes), and they certainly make a compelling
			alternative to Apache Maven.</p>
