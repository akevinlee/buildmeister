			<h1>Introduction to IBM Rational Build Forge</h2>
			<p id="articlehead">This article is an introduction to the features
			and capabilities of IBM Rational Build Forge an enterprise build and
			release execution framework. It takes you through how to implement
			Build Forge for a typical Java project.</p>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>IBM Rational Build Forge is a build and
			release&nbsp;execution framework that allows development
			organizations to standardize and automate repetitive tasks. It is not
			a direct replacement for build scripting tools such as <span
				style="font-style: italic;">make</span>, <span
				style="font-style: italic;">ClearCase clearmake</span> or <span
				style="font-style: italic;">Apache Ant</span>, rather it works in
			combination with such tools to &quot;orchestrate&quot; an end-to-end
			build, testing and release process. Indeed the Build Forge execution
			engine is open enough to be able to manage and report on any process
			consisting of a sequence of command line steps and/or scripts. Build
			Forge has been designed to be technology and platform neutral. It
			integrates with a number of version control tools to report on and
			monitor changes that go into builds (including CVS, Subversion,
			Perforce and ClearCase).</p>
			<h2>Architecture<span style="font-family: monospace;"></span></h2>
			<p>IBM Rational Build Forge has a typical 3-tier
			system architecture as illustrated in the diagram below:</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><img
				alt="[BuildForge Architecture Diagram]"
				src="%image_dir%/BuildForge-Architecture.gif" /></p>
			<p>At the bottom is the Build Forge <span
				style="font-weight: bold;">Database Server</span>. By default
			BuildForge comes with a supported DB2 express database, however it
			can be made to work with many other commercial databases include
			MySQL, Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle. In the middle is the
			<span style="font-weight: bold;">Build Forge Server</span> itself.
			This is the heart of the system and oversees all of the activities
			that are executed on the Build Forge <span style="font-weight: bold;">Agents</span>,
			including organizing projects, managing user access and permissions,
			logging, notifications,&nbsp;audit trails and so on.</p>
			<p>The agents can be deployed on practically any
			environment, including Windows, Linux and UNIX variants. It is a very
			small process that implements three basic functions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>listen for instructions from the Build Forge Server</li>
				<li>execute those instructions</li>
				<li>send the results from those instructions back to the server
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Finally, at the top are the Build Forge client
			interfaces. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Management
			Console</span> is the main control user interface for the system. Through it
			you organize the individual scripts or command line executions that
			are part of your process into projects and manage the servers and
			environments that they will be run on. An additional interface is
			provided for <strong>Developer Self Service</strong>. This interface
			integrates part of the Management Console into the <span
				style="font-weight: bold;">Developers IDE</span> (Eclipse or .NET
			based), allowing the developer to execute their own builds but using
			the Build Forge infrastructure and viewing build projects, status and
			results directly from within their IDE. There is&nbsp;also a unique
			capability allows the developer to selectively choose local file
			changes from within the IDE and &quot;reflect&quot; them into a
			controlled Build Forge integration build. Thus developers can gain
			confidence that the changes they are making will not break the team's
			build when they commit them&nbsp;back into version control.</p>
			<h2>Concepts</h2>
			<p>There are a number of concepts that are
			central to a Build Forge implementation and these are explained
			below:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span style="font-style: italic;">Projects</span><br />
				A project is the name for the overall process flow that is to be
				executed, for example you could create a project for the integration
				build of an application. <br />
				</li>
				<li><span style="font-style: italic;">Steps</span><br />
				Steps are the various tasks that are performed in the project. Each
				step is one or more command line statements that are to be executed
				on an agent. <br />
				</li>
				<li><span style="font-style: italic;">Environment</span><br />
				An environment is a collection of environment variables for example
				the <strong>PATH</strong> or <strong>JAVA_HOME</strong> setting.
				These are maintained separately from both projects and steps and can
				be assigned to projects and steps as needed. <br />
				</li>
				<li><span style="font-style: italic;">Servers</span><br />
				A server is an encapsulation of a physical machine where an agent is
				running, together with access permission and environment settings.
				When you execute a project you can decide what server you wish to
				execute it on. You can also use Build Forge's &quot;threading&quot;
				capability to execute individual steps from a project across
				multiple servers. <br />
				</li>
				<li><em>Manifests</em>, <em>Selectors</em>&nbsp;and <em>Collectors</em><br />
				Rather than specifying the physical servers that you want steps to
				execute on, you can use Build Forge selectors to specify the
				criteria for the step, for example: &quot;<em>execute this step
				on a machine with a JDK version 1.4 or greater and that is less than
				50% loaded&quot;</em>. Buid Forge achieves this by capturing manifests of
				each machine that an agent is installed on. You can also specify
				your own collector variables to gather unique information about a
				server, for example a version of a database or&nbsp;a third party
				applications. <br />
				</li>
				<li><span style="font-style: italic;">Adaptors</span><br />
				Adaptors are how you interface Build Forge with version control,
				defect or test systems. Basically, the adaptor is the application of
				an interface to a project. The interface is an XML file which
				defines functionality available via the version control, defect or
				test system, for example creating a baseline. There are a number of
				supported interfaces however you can for the ultimate in
				flexibility&nbsp;always write your own Adaptor (the documentation
				explains how to do this in detail).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As well as these core concepts, Build Forge
			also has a number of other features including full permissioning and
			security across all of its objects (projects, servers, steps etc),
			fully configurable email notification, an API you can use for
			accessing and manipulating the Build Forge database and also a
			sophisticated reporting capability. For more information on these
			capabilities see the <a href="#references">references</a> at the end
			of this article.</p>
			<h2>Install Build Forge</h2>
			<p>The first decision to make with regards to
			your Build Forge installation is which database server technology to
			use. Build Forge 7.0 and onwards can be installed automatically with
			a copy of DB2 Express, however if you have a preferred or existing
			database server, such as Oracle, SQL Server or MySQL then you can
			easily use them instead.&nbsp;Once you have decided on your database,
			the general installation process is as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Install the<span style="font-weight: bold;">IBM
				Rational FlexLM License Server</span> (if not already installed).</li>
				<li>Request and install your Build Forge license keys from the
				<a
					href="https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/preLogin.do?source=rational">IBM
				Rational Licensing Center</a>.</li>
				<li>Create a database instance and database owner for Build
				Forge to make use of.</li>
				<li>Install the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Build
				Forge Management Console</span> on a specific server and specific port.</li>
				<li>Install the latest Build Forge interim fixes (see <a
					href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/awdtools/buildforge/support/">here</a>
				for the latest versions).</li>
				<li>Install the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Build
				Forge Agents</span> on the machines you wish to execute your commands on,
				i.e. your build, version control or test servers.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The exact setup for each database will
			vary,&nbsp;refer to the latest Build Forge release notes for further
			information.&nbsp;Note: if the default DB2 Express database server is
			used then a database will be created for you, however you will first
			need to create a Windows/UNIX user account to &quot;own&quot; the
			database.</p>
			<p>To test that Build Forge has been installed
			correctly, point your Internet Browser at the Build Forge server, for
			example if you installed Build Forge on the server <span
				style="font-weight: bold;">build-server</span> and the port <span
				style="font-weight: bold;">8080</span>, you would enter the URL
			address <i>http://build-server:8080/</i> in your Internet Browser.
			You should see a screen similar to the one illustrated below:&nbsp;</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="[BuildForge Login]"
				src="%image_dir%/bf-login.jpg" /><br />
			</p>
			<p>The default login for Build Forge is the
			username <span style="font-weight: bold;">root</span> with a password
			of <span style="font-weight: bold;">root</span>. Enter this login to
			check that you successfully completed the installation. With this
			setup complete, next we will walk through an example of configuring
			Build Forge to build an example project called <em>RatlBankWeb</em>
			(the source doe for this project is available <span
				style="font-style: italic;"><a
				href="http://www.buildmeister.com/downloads/RatlBankWeb_source_1.0.zip">here</a></span>).</p>
			<h2>Create a Project Build Environment</h2>
			<p>For each development project that you want
			Build Forge to &quot;build&quot;, you need to create or make use of a
			project build environment. For a Java project versioned in IBM
			Rational ClearCase, this would typically include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>An Ant script for Build Forge to execute.</li>
				<li>A view for Build Forge to execute the build in (optional
				see below).</li>
				<li>A view which Build Forge will use to monitor ClearCase
				changes for.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For every project to be executed by Build
			Forge, you can either create a single integration build view or
			configure a step in the Build Forge project to create this view for
			you. This is made practical with Build Forge because you can create
			an additional Build Forge &ldquo;cleanup&rdquo; project that is
			called after a certain number of builds so that old views are
			removed. Whether you create a new view per build or reuse an existing
			view is really a matter of personal choice. Creating a new view every
			time will ensure a clean and repeatable build process and allow
			developers to make use of the self service &quot;reflection&quot;
			capability. However if you are creating a snapshot build view then
			the view will have to be completely loaded &ndash; which could take a
			significant amount of time for large projects. Updating an existing
			snapshot view would therefore be recommended where build times are
			significant - maybe for example when implementing continuous
			integration. In this article&nbsp;we will be creating a new snapshot
			view for every build. To be consistent we will be creating all of the
			build views under the Windows <span
				style="font-family: monospace;">C:\Builds </span>directory.</p>
			<p>The Build Forge ClearCase integration makes
			use of the capabilities of dynamic views and requires a specific view
			to be created and monitored for the integration to function
			correctly. You will therefore need to create and configure a Build
			Forge view for each project. For our <span
				style="font-style: italic;">RatlBankWeb</span> project,&nbsp;the
			dynamic view <font face="Courier New">RatlBankWeb_BF</font> will be
			created.</p>
			<h2>Create Accounts</h2>
			<p>One of the main differences between Build
			Forge and tools like CruiseControl is security. Since Build Forge has
			a database running behind it, permissions can be assigned to any of
			its objects. In Enterprise environments this is very important in
			that it enhances traceability and compliance. To create additional
			Build Forge users, access groups and to assign permissions you would
			click on&nbsp;<b>Administration, Users</b>&nbsp;in the Build Forge
			Management Console. Subsequently clicking on&nbsp;<b>Access</b> <span
				style="font-weight: bold;">Groups</span>&nbsp;lists the built-in
			Access Groups that are available out of the box. This is illustrated
			in the screenshot below:</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><img
				alt="[BuildForge Default Groups]"
				src="%image_dir%/bf-groups.jpg" /></p>
			<p>In this article we will be using
			the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Build Engineer</span> and <span
				style="font-weight: bold;">Developer</span> groups only. Clicking on
			the <b>Users</b> button will allow you to add a new user, as in the
			screenshot below which shows a new Developer account for a user
			called &ldquo;<span  style="font-family: monospace;">alex</span>&rdquo;
			being created.</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<img
				alt="[BuildForge Add User]" src="%image_dir%/bg-adduser.jpg" /></p>
			<p>As well as a new user you will probably also
			want to create at least one <b>Notification Group</b>. A notification
			group is a set of users to be emailed on specific events. For
			example, you could create a notification group called <span
				style="font-weight: bold;">Integrators </span>to be notified if a
			build succeeds or fails.</p>
			<table width="95%" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" border="1"
				style="border: medium none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: left;">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td width="95%" bgcolor="#cccccc">
						<p style="font-weight: bold;">BuildForge LDAP Authentication</p>
						<p>In common with many other IBM Rational
						tools, Build Forge also allows user authentication against a
						supported LDAP database such as Microsoft Active Directory or
						Tivoli Directory Server. This allows you to re-use corporate
						accounts&nbsp;that have already been created rather than creating
						and managing them in another database.</p>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>Once you have created users and access groups
			then you can use them to assign relevant permissions to many Build
			Forge objects, for example you might want only Build Engineers to be
			able to create new servers or projects. Alternately, you might only
			want Developers to be able to execute certain tasks (or steps) within
			a project. You could use this capability to define a Build Forge
			project whose core was accessible and executable by Developers but
			only certain steps (such as creating baselines or deploying to test
			environments) were executable by Build Engineers.</p>
			<h2>Create a Server</h2>
			<p>A Build Forge <b>Server</b> is an
			encapsulation of a physical machine on which a Build Forge Agent is
			running together with particular access permissions and environment
			settings. When you execute a Build Forge project - and the individual
			steps within it - you can use Build Forge to &quot;find&quot; a
			server for you via use of its <span style="font-weight: bold;">Manifests</span>,
			<span style="font-weight: bold;">Collectors</span> and <span
				style="font-weight: bold;">Selectors</span>.</p>
			<h3>Create a Collector</h3>
			<p>Build Forge automatically collects a <span
				style="font-weight: bold;">Manifest</span> of every physical server
			on which an Agent is installed; this includes attributes such as
			memory, disk space, load, operating system and so on. Each attribute
			in the manifest is collected by a <span style="font-weight: bold;">collector
			variable</span> (as part of an overall <span style="font-weight: bold;">Collector</span>).
			There are a large number of out-of-the-box collector variables as
			illustrated in the screenshot below:&nbsp;</p>
			<div style="text-align: center;"><img
				alt="[BuildForge Collector Variables]"
				src="%image_dir%/bg-collectors.jpg" /><br />
			</div>
			<p>You can also add you own collectors variables,
			for example to find out what version of a particular tool that is
			installed on a machine. In our example we will be making use of the
			out-of-the-box <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example</span>
			Collector.</p>
			<h3>Create a Selector</h3>
			<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Selectors</span>
			are used to specify the &quot;type&quot; of server you wish to use by
			specifying what value particular collector variables should posses.
			The Selector that&nbsp;we will be using for our example is a simple
			one as illustrated in the screenshot below:</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="[BuildForge Selector]"
				src="%image_dir%/bf-selector.jpg" /></p>
			<p>This selector simply specifies that a server
			should have at least the Java 1.4 environment and that it must be a
			Windows XP machine.&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>Create a Server</h3>
			<p>To create a new Build Forge Server click on <b>Servers,&nbsp;</b><b>Add
			Server</b>. This will display a form for entering the details of a the
			server, an example of a completed form for a new server is
			illustrated in the screenshot below:</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="[BuildForge Add Server]"
				src="%image_dir%/bf-addserver.jpg" /></p>
			<p>The example&nbsp;creates a new server called <span
				style="font-weight: bold;">Build Server 1</span> for the physical
			host <span style="font-weight: bold;">marmoset</span>. The directory
			on this server where new builds will be created (or built) is <span
				 style="font-family: monospace;">C:\Builds</span> and
			the user that commands will be executed as on this server is the
			authenticated <span style="font-weight: bold;">ClearCase Admin
			User </span>(which you can setup by clicking on <span
				style="font-weight: bold;">Servers</span>,&nbsp; <span
				style="font-weight: bold;">Server Auth</span>). The out-of-the-box <strong>Example</strong>
			Collector will be used. Note that this server can only be changed by
			users in the Build Engineer group.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>A specific Environment Group has been
			allocated to this server which contains the locations of all of the
			Java tools that are installed on it, as illustrated in the screenshot
			below (the next section will explain how to setup Environment
			Groups).</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><img
				alt="[BuildForge Java Environment Group]"
				src="%image_dir%/bf-javaenv.jpg" /></p>
			<p>Once you have created a server you should then
			test that you can connect to it successfully. You can do this by
			clicking on its <span style="font-weight: bold;">hostname</span> in
			the server list and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Test
			Connection</span>.</p>

						<td width="95%" bgcolor="#cccccc">
						<p><strong>Build Distribution</strong></p>
						<p>For large, time consuming builds you can
						spread the build load by configuring Build Forge to build across
						multiple processors and servers. Simply specify the criteria for
						servers via Selectors, e.g. operating system and server load (the
						load that a server needs to be under to determine whether it is a
						candidate to be used or not). Although Java builds are typically
						relatively short (less than an hour) and would have less use for
						such a capability than say C or C++ builds, it can still be useful
						to distribute some tasks.&nbsp;In addition this capability can be
						used to support server redundancy.</p>
						</td>

			<h2>Create a Project Environment Group</h2>
			<p>A Build Forge <b>Environment Group</b> is a
			collection of environment variables, for example the <span
				 style="font-family: monospace;">PATH </span>or <span
				style="font-family: monospace;">JAVA_HOME </span>setting. These are
			maintained separately from Build Forge projects and can be assigned
			to servers, projects and individual steps as and when needed. As well
			as operating system environment variables you can also create
			internal Build Forge environment variables which can then be used to
			configure the flow and execution of your Build Forge project. To
			create a new environment group click on&nbsp;<b>Environment</b><span
				style="font-weight: bold;">s</span>, <span
				style="font-weight: bold;">Add Environment</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Give
			the environment a name, for example &ldquo;<span
				style="font-family: monospace;">RatlBankWeb Env</span>&rdquo; and
			define who can access or change it (typically the Build Engineer),
			then start creating the variables that you require. The minimum set
			of environment variables that will be required for the execution of
			the <span style="font-style: italic;">RatlBankWeb</span> project is
			illustrated in the screenshot below:</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><img
				alt="[BuildForge Project Environment]"
				src="%image_dir%/bf-projectenv.jpg" /></p>
			<p>Note that there are a number of ways to
			&ldquo;create&rdquo; environment variables. You can assign new ones
			(as in the majority of the screenshot), clear or append to existing
			ones (as in the <span  style="font-family: monospace;">PATH
			</span>variable for the Java Tools Environment) as well as specify what the
			project can &ldquo;do&rdquo; to the variable, i.e. whether it is
			changeable, or read-only.</p>
			<h2>Define the Project</h2>
			<p>A Build Forge <b>Project</b> is the name for
			the overall process flow that is to be executed. Build Forge <b>Steps</b>
			are the various tasks that are performed within the project. Each
			step is basically one or more command line statements that are to be
			executed on an Agent. A Build Forge project is typically created for
			each application you wish to build. In our example&nbsp;we will
			create a single Build Forge project for executing the <span
				style="font-style: italic;">RatlBankWeb</span> Integration Build. To
			create a new project click on&nbsp;<b>Projects</b>,&nbsp;<b>Add
			Project.</b> Give the project a name, for example &ldquo;<span
				style="font-family: monospace;">RatlBankWeb Int</span>&rdquo; and
			define who can access or change it (typically the Build Engineer).
			Select the Build Forge environment group that the project will make
			use of (i.e. &ldquo;<span style="font-family: monospace;">RatlBankWeb
			Env</span>&rdquo; as defined previously) and the Build Forge Selector that
			will be used to find which server to&nbsp;run it on. You can also
			select whether to notify groups of users on build success or failure
			(via notification groups) and whether data will be kept or purged for
			the project by selecting its class (<span
				style="font-family: monospace;"><span
				style="font-weight: bold;">Scratch</span> or <span
				style="font-weight: bold;">Production</span></span><span
				style="font-family: monospace;">).</span> Finally you can also
			define the Build <b>Tag</b> <b>Format</b>. In this case we will
			simply create a tag in the format&nbsp;<span
				style="font-family: monospace;">BLD_<span
				style="font-style: italic;">XXX</span></span><span
				style="font-style: italic;">,</span> however you could specify
			whatever tag format you liked for example <i
				style="font-family: monospace;">MAJ</i><span
				style="font-family: monospace;">.<i>MIN</i>.<i>FIX</i>.<i>BUILD
			</i></span>and whether each component of the tag was fixed or incremented. An
			example of the project created for execution of the <span
				style="font-style: italic;">RatlBankWeb</span> builds is illustrated
			in the screenshot below:</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><img
				alt="[BuildForge Add Project]"
				src="%image_dir%/bf-addproject.jpg" /></p>
			<p>Once you have created a project you can then
			define its steps. To do this, click on the <span
				style="font-weight: bold;">Project</span> and then <b>Add Step</b>.
			The first important thing to decide is what, where and how the step
			will be executed. This can be broken down into a number of categories
			as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span style="font-style: italic;">Command</span> &ndash;
				the command line that the step is to execute &ndash; for example,
				calls to the ClearCase <span
					style="font-family: monospace;">cleartool</span> command, an Ant
				build script or some other custom script. <br />
				</li>
				<li><span style="font-style: italic;">Selector</span> &ndash;
				the type of machine that the step is to be executed on &ndash; this
				defaults to the Build Forge Project Selector specified at the
				project level.&nbsp; <br />
				</li>
				<li><span style="font-style: italic;">Access</span> &ndash; who
				is allowed to change or execute the step &ndash; you can specify
				that different users are allowed to run different steps, for example
				you might not want Developers to be able to execute the step which
				creates a new baseline.&nbsp; <br />
				</li>
				<li><span style="font-style: italic;">Directory</span> &ndash;
				the file system directory in which the step is to be executed
				&ndash; the step can be executed either from a directory at the
				server level (i.e. <span style="font-family: monospace;">C:\Builds</span>
				as we defined for our server) or at the project level (i.e. a
				project specific directory off the server root -&nbsp;for the first
				build this would be <span
					style="font-family: monospace;">C:\Builds\RatlBankWeb_Int\1_INT</span>).
				In our example we will be using the server level setting and then
				specifying the subdirectory inside there where we wish the build to
				be carried out.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>An example step to create the integration
			build view for the <span style="font-style: italic;">RatlBankWeb</span>
			project is illustrated in the screenshot below:</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><img
				alt="[BuildForge Example Step]"
				src="%image_dir%/bf-samplestep.jpg" /></p>
			<p>Note that it is good practice to create a step
			for each command line invocation or script rather than putting a
			number of invocations in the same step. This is because Build Forge
			assesses success or failure of the step from the exit code of the
			commands that are being run. If a number of commands are in the same
			step then it is only the exit value of the <i>last</i> commands that
			would be used to determine the success or failure of the step.</p>
			<p>The complete set of Build Forge steps required
			to compile,&nbsp; test and deploy (to a development server) the <span
				style="font-style: italic;">RatlBankWeb</span> project can be
			implemented in a similar way. The screenshot below illustrates the
			complete set of steps:</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<img
				alt="[BuildForge All Steps]" src="%image_dir%/bf-allsteps.jpg" />&nbsp;</p>

						<p class="SH" style="font-weight: bold; page-break-after: auto;"><a
							name="_Toc105376773">Defining Build Forge Filters</a></p>
						<p>Not every command you wish to execute from
						Build Forge will always terminate with an appropriate exit code.
						One such example is the Windows Ant batch file which terminates
						with a successful exit code irrespective of whether the build
						passed or failed. In this case rather than determining success or
						failure of the step based on exit code you can create a filter to
						parse the output of the command by searching for appropriate text
						in the build log. When an Ant build fails the build output always
						includes the message &ldquo;<span
							style="font-family: monospace;">BUILD FAILED</span>&rdquo;. It is
						therefore safe to create a Build Forge filter which searches for
						this string. Once you have created the filter, rather than
						selecting&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Exit Code</span>
						in the <b>Result</b> field, you would select the name of your Ant
						filter.</p>

			You will notice that the majority of the steps in this project are
			calls to Ant targets, although it would be possible to call a single
			Ant target, i.e. &ldquo;<span
				style="font-family: monospace;">ant release</span>&rdquo; to execute
			all of these as dependencies, this would not take advantage of the
			capabilities of Build Forge. By breaking them down as discrete steps,
			if the build fails at a particular step, you can potentially fix the
			problem and restart the build at that step. You can also thread a
			number of these steps by executing them in parallel to save total
			build time.&nbsp;</p>
			<h2>Test the Project</h2>
			<p>Once you have a suitable Build Forge project
			you should then test it. To do this, click on <span
				style="font-weight: bold;">Project Runs, Start</span> and select the
			&quot;<span style="font-family: monospace;">RatlBankWeb Int</span>&quot;
			project. You will be shown the environment variables, tag and
			selector that will be used for this execution. Finally click on the <b>Execute</b>
			button to start execution of the project. Click on the Build Tag to
			see each step execute&nbsp; in turn as illustrated in the screenshot
			below:</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<img
				alt="[BuildForge Project Execution]"
				src="%image_dir%/bf-execute.jpg" /></p>
			<p>You can click on any of these steps to see
			what commands have been executed and their output. Finally, you can
			also click on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bill of
			Materials</span> (BOM) link under <span style="font-weight: bold;">Project
			Runs</span>. At this point, the contents of the BOM are not that interesting
			as they will simply display the steps that have been executed.
			However, once ClearCase and ClearQuest have been integrated with
			Build Forge then the BOM can be used to display the source code
			changes and defects that have gone into the build. In the next
			section, we will discuss how to enable the ClearCase and ClearQuest
			integration to achieve just that.</p>
			<h2>Build Forge&nbsp;ClearCase Integration</h2>
			<p>So far we have looked at how to execute a
			simple Java Ant build using Build Forge. However one of the major
			benefits of Build Forge comes when you integrate with a version
			control provider to initiate and report on the software versions that
			have gone into a build. This integration is enabled in Build Forge
			through the use of an <b>Adaptor</b>. Adaptors are how you interface
			Build Forge with version control, defect or test tools. Basically,
			the adaptor is the application of an interface to a project. The
			interface is an XML file which defines functionality available via
			the version control, defect or test system, for example creating a
			ClearCase baseline and reporting on its activities. There are a
			number of supported interfaces, however you can for the ultimate in
			flexibility,&nbsp;always write your own. In this section we will look
			at how to create a <b>Source</b> adaptor interface to ClearCase and
			then link it to our <span style="font-style: italic;">RatlBankWeb</span>
			project.</p>
			<h3>Add an Interface to ClearCase</h3>
			<p>To add an interface to ClearCase click on the <b>Administration,
			Adaptor</b>s button then click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add
			Adaptor</span><b>.</b> Give the interface a name, i.e. &ldquo;<span
				 style="font-family: monospace;">RatlBankWeb CC
			IF</span>&rdquo;, select <span style="font-weight: bold;">Source</span> Mode
			and the <b>ClearCase</b> template. Click on <b>Save Adaptor</b> to
			complete the process. Once the interface has been created if you
			click on its name you will see the contents of the XML file that has
			been imported. This is illustrated in the screenshot below:</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<img
				alt="[ClearCase Adaptor]"
				src="%image_dir%/bf-clearcaseadaptor.jpg" /></p>
			<p>You can also use this screen to make changes to
			the interface, and add more functionality if required.&nbsp;we will
			not be making any changes to the interface in this chapter, however
			if you wish to do so then the process is described in detail in the
			Build Forge Implementation Guide.</p>
			<h3>Link the Interface to the Project</h3>
			<p>In order to make use of an interface you can
			either call one of its entry points as a step in your project
			or&nbsp;link it directly to a&nbsp;project. To do the later, click on
			<span style="font-weight: bold;">Adaptor Links</span> and <b>Add
			Adaptor Link</b>. This will display a form for entering the details of
			the link. An example of a completed form is illustrated in the
			screenshot below. Make sure you select <strong>Populate Env</strong>
			as this will add variables to your environment group that need to be
			changed to make the adaptor work.</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img
				alt="[ClearCase Adaptor Link]"
				src="%image_dir%/bf-addclearcaselink.jpg" /></p>
			<p><a name="_Toc105376774">In this&nbsp;example
			a new source link to the &ldquo;</a><span
				style="font-family: monospace;">RatlBankWeb Int</span>&rdquo;
			project is created and the&nbsp;<b>ByDate&nbsp;</b>entry point is
			used. Currently there are three entry points for the ClearCase
			Adaptor as follows:</p>
			<table width="95%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" border="1">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td bgcolor="#66ffff">
						<p><strong>Name</strong></p>
						</td>
						<td bgcolor="#66ffff">
						<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td bgcolor="#cccccc">
						<p><strong>ByDate</strong></p>
						</td>
						<td bgcolor="#cccccc">
						<p>Gather the list of source changes since the time of the
						last build.</p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td bgcolor="#cccccc">
						<p><strong>ByLabel</strong></p>
						</td>
						<td bgcolor="#cccccc">
						<p style="text-align: justify;">Apply a Base ClearCase label
						to your source and then find the difference between the new label
						and the label that was applied in the previous execution of
						thebuild.</p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td bgcolor="#cccccc">
						<p><strong>ByBaseline</strong></p>
						</td>
						<td bgcolor="#cccccc">
						<p style="text-align: justify;">Apply a ClearCase UCM baseline
						to your source and then find the difference between the new
						baseline and the baseline that was applied in the previous
						execution of the build.</p>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ByDate
			</span>entry point&nbsp;is more suitable for continuous integration as it
			can be used to check for changes before initiating a build. The other
			two entry points assume that changes have been made already and apply
			metadata (a label or baseline) to find what out they are.</p>
			<p>As well as specifying the entry point you will
			need to configure the interface, for example specifying the ClearCase
			view to be used to check for changes, the VOB path and so on. In
			Build Forge this is carried out by creating new environment
			variables. If you selected <span style="font-weight: bold;">Populate
			Env</span> then these environment variables would have been created for you.
			If you now go back and edit the environment group you will see that
			it contains some new variables. You will need to configure these
			appropriately. The screenshot below illustrates the configuration of
			these variables for the <span style="font-style: italic;">RatlBankWeb</span>
			project.</p>
			<div style="text-align: center;"><img
				alt="[ClearCase Adaptor Environment Variables]"
				src="%image_dir%/bf-adaptorenvs.jpg" /><br />
			</div>
			<p>The <span
				style="font-family: monospace;">VIEW </span>variable refers to the
			ClearCase dynamic view that is to be checked for changes. You should
			also set the <span  style="font-family: monospace;">LAST_RUN
			</span>variable to the current time as Build Forge uses this variable to
			determine the starting time to look for changes - it will
			subsequently update this variable every time it executes a build.
			With this interface in place you can execute a Build Forge project
			build as described earlier - this time though, the build would only
			execute if changes were found. Rather than execute builds manually
			this particular capability is of more use if the project is scheduled
			to execute. For example, you could schedule the project to execute,
			say every 20 minutes, and build automatically if changes were found.
			This is the mechanism that Build Forge uses to implement continuous
			integration.</p>
			<table width="95%" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" border="0">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td valign="top" bgcolor="#cccccc">
						<p class="SH" style="font-weight: bold;">Debugging Adaptors</p>
						<p>If source code changes are not found by the
						adaptor, then the project will execute for just a couple of
						seconds and disappear. This is expected but makes debugging very
						difficult. You can enable adaptor debugging by clicking on the <b
							style="font-weight: bold;">Administration</b> button then
						clicking on <b>System</b> and then finally setting the variable <b>Link
						Debug Mode</b> to <b>Yes</b>. This then allows you to run a project
						linked to an adaptor but only execute the adaptor step. The build
						will remain as a completed build whether changes are found or not.</p>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<h3>Schedule the Project</h3>
			<p>To schedule the project click on&nbsp;<b>Schedule</b>
			and then on <b>Add Schedule.</b> This will display a form for
			entering the details of the schedule. An example of a completed form
			is illustrated&nbsp;below. In this scenario the <span
				style="font-style: italic;">RatlBankWeb</span> project has been
			scheduled to build every 20 minutes.</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><b>&nbsp;<img
				alt="[BuildForge Schedule]" src="%image_dir%/bf-schedule.jpg" /></b>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>You can create as many schedules as you want;
			other scenarios would include implementing daily or nightly builds at
			specific times. You can also change the mode of a schedule to fire
			only once or to be temporarily disabled.</p>
			<h4>Test the Project</h4>
			<p>Once you have created the ClearCase interface
			and schedule, to test the project make a change in ClearCase. If you
			then click on&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Project
			Runs</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Running</span>&nbsp;you should
			eventually see the build automatically start at the scheduled
			interval. The project will execute each step in turn, when it has
			completed click on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Completed</span>
			then click on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bill of
			Materials</span>. This time you should see a section for <b>Source
			Changes</b> as in the example below:</p>
			<p align="center" style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<img
				alt="[Source Changes]" src="%image_dir%/bf-sourcechanges.jpg" /></p>
			<p>Information is displayed on both the version
			of the file that has changed and the details of the change itself in
			&ldquo;diff&rdquo; format. In this case a line has been changed. If a
			lot of changes are implemented in a single build then checking for
			the lines that have changed could take some time. You can disable
			this capability in the ClearCase interface if this is an issue.</p>
			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>IBM Rational Build Forge is a powerful
			framework for managing, accelerating and improving your build
			processes. It does not require you to throw away any of the scripts
			or tools that you have patiently implemented, rather it allows you to
			manage, expose and refine their execution. The real benefit of the
			tool is that it allows you to start to consolidate and manage
			disparate build processes across an organization and to extend your
			existing build processes out into other areas or teams - ultimately
			to create a complete end-to-end software delivery process. There
			are&nbsp;many other capabilities of Build Forge which make it more
			suitable for enterprise use, such as library projects, security,
			build classes and&nbsp;metrics and reports. It is not possible to
			discuss all of these&nbsp;in this article, however hopefully iy has
			given you a flavor of what is possible with Build Forge and that the
			value it can bring to an organization.</p>
