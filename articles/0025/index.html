<h1>Auditing Java builds with IBM Rational ClearCase and Apache Ant</h1>
<p id="articlehead">This article describes how to use the Apache Ant build
audit listener that is delivered with ClearCase version 7 and later.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Build Auditing</span> refers to
the capability whereby during the build process, the versions of all the
source files used, the compilation settings and the environment are
automatically recorded. With ClearCase you can achieve this only if you
are using dynamic views, as the ClearCase Multi-Version File System
(MVFS) that is used with dynamic views, audits all the low-level system
calls (opens, reads, writes) that are performed on ClearCase data. This
capability was primarily designed for C or C++ builds carried out using
the <span style="font-weight: bold;">clearmake</span> tool; however it
can still be used for Java builds. In this article I will describe the
build auditing capability in more detail and how it can be used for
auditing Ant initiated Java builds. First however, I will explain some
of the concepts behind build auditing: <span style="font-weight: bold;">derived
objects</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">configuration
records.</span></p>
<h2>Derived objects</h2>
<p>A derived object is any file that is created by a build script
under the control of one of the ClearCase <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">clearmake</span>, <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">omake</span> or <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">clearaudit</span> commands. Derived objects
can only be created in dynamic views and they can be <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">shareable</span> or <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">non-shareable</span>. During a clearmake or
omake audited build, information about any newly built derived objects
is written to the ClearCase VOB. This information can then be used by
future builds to determine whether the derived object can be re-used,
thus avoiding rebuilding it and potentially decreasing the build time.
The process of pulling in a derived object already built in another view
is called &ldquo;<span style="font-weight: bold;">winking in</span>&rdquo;
and derived objects created in this way are thereby called shareable.</p>
<div id="keyconcepts">
<p align="center"><b><u>Key Concepts</u></b></p>
<p><b>MVFS</b> - Multi-Version File System used by ClearCase to
audit file system operations.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">dynamic view</span> - a
&quot;virtual&quot; networked file system that uses MVFS and allows
build auditing to be carried out</p>
<p><b>derived object </b>- object created as a result of a build,
usually a binary but can be any &quot;derived&quot; file.</p>
<p><b>configuration record </b>- data that describes how a derived
object was created, i.e. the code versions that went into it, the build
script and so on.</p>
</div>
<p>As shareable derived objects can only be created and re-used when
a build is invoked via the clearmake or omake commands you have to write
makefiles to take advantage of this capability. This is obviously not
something today&rsquo;s Java developers are usually prepared to
undertake. However, an audited build invoked by the <span
	style="font-family: monospace;">clearaudit</span> command or the
ClearCase Ant &ldquo;build audit listener&rdquo; can also create derived
objects. These derived objects are non-shareable as they cannot be
automatically re-used by builds initiated in other views. However the
information about the derived object, such as each of the file versions
that went into producing it, can still be reported on and used.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-family: monospace;">cleartool lsdo</span>
command is used to find and query on derived objects. This command
displays the fully qualified names of all derived objects created in the
current VOB directory regardless of the view in which the derived object
was built. As an example, for a traditional C++ project, <span
	style="font-family: monospace;">cleartool lsdo</span> might produce the
following output:</p>
<div id="codeoutput">&gt;<span style="font-weight: bold;">M:\build_view\CPPBank\&gt;cleartool
lsdo</span><br />
14-Sep.20:28&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Account.o@@15-Jan.20:28.110&quot;<br />
14-Sep.19:56&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Account.o@@14-Jan.19:56.105&quot;<br />
14-Sep.19:56&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Bank.o@@14-Jan.19:56.104&quot;<br />
14-Sep.20:28&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;BankTest.exe@@15-Jan.20:28.111&quot;<br />

14-Sep.19:56&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;TransRecord.o@@14-Jan.19:56.107&quot;</div>
<p>In this example, you can see a number of derived objects, either
Windows executables or object files. As in this case, an environment may
consist of many different derived objects that are essentially variants
of the same file, for example multiple instances of an executable that
has been built but with different versions of code. To distinguish
between them, each derived object has an extended name in the <span
	style="font-family: monospace;">form <span
	style="font-style: italic;">filename@@unique-identifier</span></span>, for
example:</p>
<div id="codeoutput">BankTest.exe@@14-Jan.19:56.108</div>
<p>Each derived object also has an associated <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">configuration record</span> which describes
how it was constructed. Note you might see a different variant of
identifier (e.g., <span style="font-family: monospace;">BankTest.exe@@2006--01-14T19:56.108</span>)
depending on what environment you are working in. I will discuss
configuration records next.</p>
<h2>Configuration records</h2>
<p>A configuration record is a compiled object and is not viewable
using standard operating system commands. Instead you must use the <span
	style="font-family: monospace;">cleartool catcr &lt;<span
	style="font-style: italic;">derived object identifier</span>&gt;</span>
command, for example:<br />
</p>
<div id="codeoutput">&gt;cleartool catcr
Account.o@@15-Jan.20:28.110</div>
<p>Executing this command would produce output similar to that shown
in the following:</p>
<div id="codeoutput">Derived object:
\CPPBank\RationalBank\Account.o@@15-Jan.20:28.110<br />

----------------------------</div>
<p>Note that you will only generate a configuration record if you
use clearmake, omake or clearaudit to initiate the build. However
clearaudit has some auditing limitations compared to the two others
(this is indicated in the following list). In general therefore, a
configuration record consists of the following sections.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Header section<br />
	Shows what, who, where, when, and what view initiated the build.</li>
	<li>MVFS section<br />
	Shows all the MVFS files and directories read during the build:&nbsp;
	versioned objects and view private files (including checked-out
	versions) as well as all the derived objects produced by the target
	rebuild.</li>
	<li>Non-MVFS section<br />
	Shows any declared dependencies outside a VOB - identified by a date
	and time stamp.</li>
	<li>Variables and Options section (clearmake/omake only)<br />
	Show any macros defined during the build.</li>
	<li>Build Script section (clearmake/omake only)<br />
	Shows the actual script that was read from the makefile and executed by
	clearmake or omake.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are various options you can use to customise the display of
the configuration record, as well as an additional and sometimes very
useful command <span style="font-family: monospace;">cleartool
diffcr</span> to compare two derived objects. Essentially, this command can be
used to show you the difference (in ClearCase element versions) between
derived objects.</p>
<h2>Auditing Ant builds with ClearCase</h2>
<p>In order to audit your Ant based Java builds you can use the
ClearCase Ant &ldquo;build audit listener&rdquo;. This is an Ant library
which audits aspects of your build process, allowing you to create
derived objects and configuration records for Java builds. Note however,
that this capability does not give you automatic build avoidance
capabilities. The listener comes bundled with ClearCase as the file <span
	style="font-family: monospace;">CCAudits.jar</span> and is held in the
ClearCase <span style="font-family: monospace;">bin</span> directory. In
order for Ant to execute this listener successfully, you will need to
add the path to the <span style="font-family: monospace;">CCAudits.jar</span>
file to your Java <span style="font-family: monospace;">CLASSPATH</span>.
For example on Windows, your <span style="font-family: monospace;">CLASSPATH</span>
should be set similar to the following:</p>
<div id="codeoutput">CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;C:\Program
Files\Rational\ClearCase\bin\CCAudits.jar</div>
<p>Whereas on Linux or Unix, it should be set similar to the
following:</p>
<div id="codeoutput">CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:&quot;/opt/rational/clearcase/java/lib/CCAudits.jar&quot;</div>
<p>On Windows you can set this configuration permanently by setting
the environment variables using the System Applet in the Control Panel;
on Linux or Unix you can add the <span style="font-family: monospace;">CLASSPATH</span>
setting to your login script. Once you have specified a suitable <span
	style="font-family: monospace;">CLASSPATH</span>, you must then decide
which Ant tasks you want to audit. You can specify the set of tasks by
adding the following line to your <span style="font-family: monospace;">default.properties</span>
or <span style="font-family: monospace;">build.properties</span> file:</p>
<div id="codeoutput">CCAudits.auditable_task_list=javac:jar:war</div>
<p>This example will audit the <span style="font-weight: bold;">javac</span>,
<span style="font-weight: bold;">jar</span> and <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">war</span> tasks (if you do not specify any
values for this property, the default audited task list is the <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">javac</span>, <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">javah</span>, <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">jar</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">war</span>
and <span style="font-weight: bold;">ear</span> tasks). To execute an
audited build, you would simply execute your normal Ant target but
specify the &ldquo;build audit listener&rdquo; as follows:</p>
<div id="codeoutput">&gt;ant &ndash;listener CCAudits dist</div>
<p>This would execute an audited build of the Ant <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">dist</span> target. <br />
</p>
<p>When a build is executed in a dynamic view and using the
&ldquo;build audit listener&rdquo; every build output (i.e. Java class
files) is recorded as a derived object. A number of additional derived
objects are also created in the <span style="font-family: monospace;">CCAudits</span>
directory where the build was executed from. This directory contains a
set of derived objects named after your project and audited targets. For
each build audit ClearCase creates a single configuration record,
recording all the source versions used. All MVFS files read during
execution of the audited shell are listed as inputs to the build and all
MVFS files created become derived objects, associated with the single
configuration record. What this means is that after the build has
finished, if you carried out a listing of the derived objects using the
<span style="font-family: monospace;">cleartool lsdo</span> command you
would see output similar to the following:</p>
<div id="codeoutput">&gt;<span style="font-weight: bold;">M:\RatlBankModel_rel\RatlBankSources\model&gt;cleartool
lsdo &ndash;recurse</span><br />

<p>In this example, as well as the list of derived objects, you can
also see the Variables and Options section recording how the build was
constructed in terms of JDK and Ant version. The only caveat to this
process is that the configuration information will only be available as
long as the derived objects are in existence. If you subsequently
execute an Ant <span style="font-weight: bold;">clean</span>, then the
derived objects will be removed. However, you can check-in (or stage)
the derived object to preserve this information.</p>
<p>Earlier on I mentioned about being able to compare configuration
records. Well let us suppose that you used the process described above
and now have two derived objects called X and Y. For the second build
you knew that a number of elements had been changed but you were not
quite sure exactly which ones. To find out this information you could
use the <span style="font-family: monospace;">cleartool diffcr</span>
command as follows:</p>
<div id="codeoutput">&gt;cleartool diffcr &ndash;flat
&ndash;ele &ndash;s X Y</div>
<p>The arguments to the <span style="font-family: monospace;">diffcr</span>
command (<span style="font-family: monospace;">-flat &ndash;ele</span>)
produce a nicely formatted output of just the ClearCase elements that
have changed. The output from this command would be similar to the
following:</p>

<p>As you can see, the difference between these two builds and that
has been highlighted is with the Java files <span
	style="font-family: monospace;">Account.java</span> and <span
	style="font-family: monospace;">Customer.java</span>, which have had
new versions implemented in the later build.<br />

<h2>In use</h2>
<p>Ant build auditing is a feature that is unique to ClearCase. It
is undoubtedly a powerful and &quot;interesting&quot; capability,
however you will need to assess whether it can be a productive part of
your build process. Executing builds in dynamic views will increase the
total build time, so if build time is your most important requirement
then you would find it hard to justify this capability. However if you
were working in a&nbsp;secure or audited environment, then the
capability that build auditing provides can go a long way to helping you
achieve your aims. From a pragmatic point of view, you might be best
executing your release builds using Ant build auditing, whereas day to
day integration builds - which tend to be thrown away - can be executed
using snapshot views as&nbsp; normal.</p>
