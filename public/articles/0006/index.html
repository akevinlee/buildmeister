<h1>Version Control Requirements for the Build Process</h1>
<p id="articlehead">This article describes a set of
requirements that any version control tool should meet in order for it
to successfully enable repeatability, reliability and scalability of the
Build Process.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Version control tools are chosen for many reasons but rarely
is the impact of such a choice assessed in terms of how it would affects
your build processes - both current and future. Obviously, it is
fundamental that your build processes are as efficient as possible,
and there is no reason for them to be constrained by limitations of
your version control toolset. Indeed, it has repeatedly been seen in
many organizations that when version control tools do not enable
development teams to develop and build software in the manner in which
they would like, alternative version tools are chosen instead.
This article therefore attempts to summarize a basic set of requirements
that any version control tool should fulfill in order to satisfy the
requirements of a generic build process. There might be a few extra
requirements depending on the technology that you are using but the
majority of these requirements should be both technology and process
agnostic.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>The following requirements are given in no specific order:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Namespace Refactoring</b>
	<p>During active development files will inevitably get refactored -
	i.e. renamed, moved or deleted. In effect this involves a change in the
	directory - or namespace - in which they are referenced. Builds are
	carried out at discrete points in time, if you need to reproduce a
	build you need to guarantee that all the files that existed at that
	point in time are present - and nothing more or less. If a version
	control tool fully supports namespace refactoring then it will track
	changes over time and allow you to revert back to an exact point,
	guaranteeing that the files and versions that it presents it to you are
	as they existed. Some version controls achieve this by versioning
	directories, others by versioning the complete repository. Other
	version control tools however have been know to fail miserably with
	this requirement; when you delete a file using such tools for example,
	not only does it delete the version of the file at the current point in
	time but it also destroys its complete history.<br />
	</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Immutable Baselines</b>
	<p>At some stage in your build process you will need to create a
	baseline, this can be before or after your build. Baselines have
	different names in different tools: tags, labels, configurations and so
	on. The point is that by creating a baseline you have to decided to
	mark a composite set of versions of files as compatible. Placing down a
	baseline enables you to revert back to this composite set of versions
	quickly and easily, for example if you wanted to reproduce an old build
	or fix a defect. Baselines should be immutable, that is the composite
	set of versions that they refer to cannot be changed or the baseline
	deleted. Doing so would compromise your ability to rebuild. Immutable
	baselines are often supported by <b>Namespace Refactoring</b> and <b>Enforceable
	Security</b>.</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Effective Branching</b>
	<p>It is almost inevitable that some point in time you will need to
	branch your code base - although the amount of branching that you carry
	out will be dependent on the environment in which you are
	working and the development processes which you are following.
	Branching also directly affects your build process, for example if you
	are fixing a defect you need to ensure that a build workspace can be
	setup to look at a historical baseline and the branched (fixed) code
	as quickly as possible. In some circumstances branching can
	directly support your build process, for example you can create a
	branch for release stabilization - allowing you to carry out quick and
	minor fixes during the build whilst active development continues.
	Consequently, branching when it is needed, should be as effective as
	possible. Branches should also be created just-in-time using the
	version control tool, with branches only being applied to those
	versions of files that need to be changed.</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Enforceable Security</b>
	<p>How much security you need is really dependent on the
	environment in which you are working. However, even in open
	environments you will steed need a degree of security - even if only to
	prevent users from making mistakes. From a build point of view you
	would not want unauthorized users to be able to delete, rename, or
	change your build baselines. Neither would you want them using any
	build-specific branches or workspaces that you have created for
	building in. From the build point of view therefore, enforceable
	security should look at how any supporting version control
	metadata (branches, baselines etc) can be prevented from changes by
	unauthorized users. It should included capabilities to say what the set
	of authorized users are, as well as be able to display customized error
	or warning information which the security restrictions are met.</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Accessible Reporting</b>
	<p>A large part of any build process is reporting on its outcome.
	This could be reporting on why it has failed or reporting on what
	exactly has gone into and been created by the build in terms of
	versions, changes and binaries. Version control tools should allow you
	to readily access this kind of information, allowing you to report on
	differences between builds - usually through baseline reports - and to
	list the new uncontrolled files that have been created in the workspace
	as an output of the build. They should also allow you to customize this
	information - to allow it conform to your organizational
	requirements. Although version control tools can be <b>Easily
	Integrated</b> to - via the command line for example - this presumes a
	degree of skill and effort that it is often not available. Therefore
	out of the box, <b>Accessible Reporting</b> from your version
	control tool is really what is required to support your build process
	from a reporting point of view.</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Easily Integrated</b>
	<p>A build process is not just about compiling code, there will be
	many ways in which you will want to use your build and version control
	tool as part of your overall build process. For example scheduling
	builds on changes, producing release reports, integrating with other
	tools such as bug tracking or testing tools. A version control should
	therefore be open enough to support such requests. At a minimum this
	should be in the form of a command line interface, but also preferably
	in the form of a supported API or reusable (web) service.</p>
	</li>
