<h1>Introduction to NAnt</h1>
<p id="articlehead">A brief introduction to the features and capabilities of
NAnt.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>NAnt is a Microsoft .NET build tool, although based on <a
	href="http://www.buildmeister.com//modules/content/index.php?id=13">Apache
Ant</a> (the de-facto standard for building Java projects) it is <b>N</b>ot
<b>Ant</b> (hence the name) and has subsequently evolved in its own
unique way. Where Ant is Java-centric, NAnt is .NET-centric and has
built in support for compiling C#, VB.NET, J# languages as well as for
building Visual Studio .NET solutions. Since NAnt is written for the
.NET platform it is also extensible via use of any .NET languages,
allowing you to build on its features and facilities to integrate it
with all manner of tools and systems.</p>
<p>All NAnt builds are driven by an XML formatted build file (the
equivalent of a make &ldquo;<font face="Courier New">makefile</font>&rdquo;).
By default this is typically called <font face="Courier New">NAnt.build</font>
and located in the project root directory. However, there is no reason
why a project can&rsquo;t contain a number of build files of any given
name. NAnt allows you to call or chain these files together, if for
example you want to build recursively down a directory structure
containing multiple projects.</p>
<p>The build file always references a single <b>project</b>, i.e. an
application. The project has a number of <b>targets</b> that can be
called. These targets are the core parts of a build process, i.e.
compile, test, generate distribution (<font face="Courier New">.zip</font>
or <font face="Courier New">.msi</font>) files, deploy and so on. Each
of the targets can be called individually or they can be
&quot;chained&quot; together as <span style="font-weight: bold;">dependencies</span>
to orchestrate an end-to-end build. For example, to build a release
version of an application you could use the following command line
invocation:</p>
<div id="codeoutput">&gt;nant release</div>
<p>Each of the targets can make reference to any of
NAnt's built-in <b>tasks</b><i>. </i>A task is basically an interface to
a .NET class written to carry out a predefined operation, i.e. compile a
set of source files, delete a directory structure and so on. Attributes
are specified for the tasks, defining their exact invocation. There are
a large number of built-in tasks (see the <a
	href="http://nant.sourceforge.net/release/latest/help/tasks/index.html">NAnt
manual</a> for details), however since the tasks are interfaces to .NET
classes, you can quite easily extend NAnt by creating new tasks
yourself.</p>
<h2>An Example</h2>
<p>A simple example of an NAnt build file to compile and test a
Visual Studio .NET solution is given below:</p>
<pre name="code" class="xml">
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;

&lt;project name=&quot;NAntDemo&quot; default=&quot;build&quot;&gt;
    &lt;property name=&quot;project.name&quot; value=&quot;NAntDemo&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;property name=&quot;project.version&quot; value=&quot;1.0.0&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;property name=&quot;dir.nunit&quot; value=&quot;C:\Program Files\NUnit 2.2\bin&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;property name=&quot;configuration&quot; value=&quot;debug&quot;/&gt;

    &lt;!-- remove generated files --&gt;
    &lt;target name=&quot;clean&quot; description=&quot;remove all generated files&quot;&gt;
        &lt;delete&gt;
            &lt;fileset&gt;
                &lt;include name=&quot;**/bin/**&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;include name=&quot;**/obj/**&quot; /&gt;
                &lt;include name=&quot;**/*.user/**&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;/fileset&gt;
        &lt;/delete&gt;
    &lt;/target&gt;

    &lt;!-- execute a debug build --&gt;
    &lt;target name=&quot;debug&quot; description=&quot;execute a debug build&quot;&gt;
        &lt;property name=&quot;configuration&quot; value=&quot;debug&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;call target=&quot;test&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/target&gt;<br />

    &lt;!-- execute a release build --&gt;
    &lt;target name=&quot;release&quot; description=&quot;execute a release build&quot;&gt;
        &lt;property name=&quot;configuration&quot; value=&quot;release&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;call target=&quot;test&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/target&gt;

    &lt;!-- compile source code --&gt;
        &lt;target name=&quot;build&quot; depends=&quot;clean&quot; description=&quot;compile the source code&quot;&gt;
        &lt;solution configuration=&quot;${configuration}&quot; solutionfile=&quot;${project.name}.sln&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/target&gt;

    &lt;!-- execute unit tests --&gt;
    &lt;target name=&quot;test&quot; depends=&quot;build&quot; description=&quot;run unit tests.&quot;&gt;
        &lt;exec program=&quot;${dir.nunit}\nunit-console.exe&quot;
            commandline=&quot;${project.name}.nunit /xml=${project.name}-test.xml /nologo&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/target&gt;<br />

    &lt;!-- run the application --&gt;
    &lt;target name=&quot;run&quot; depends=&quot;test&quot;&gt;
        &lt;exec program=&quot;${project.name}.exe&quot;
            basedir=&quot;${project.name}\bin\${configuration}\&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/target&gt;<br />

&lt;/project&gt;
</pre>
<p>In this example we have have a project named <i>NAntDemo</i>,
there are six targets: <span style="font-weight: bold;">clean,</span> <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">debug,</span> <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">release,</span> <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">build,</span> <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">test </span>and <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">run.</span> Sometimes a target will have a
dependency on another target, for example before you test an
application, you would obviously need to build the application first!
These dependencies are easily specified via a <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">depends </span>attribute in the target. We
can see this with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">test </span>target
on line 40 (where the target requires the <span
	style="font-weight: bold;">build </span>target to be executed first).
NAnt will automatically execute any dependencies.</p>
<p>You will see that in the example on lines 4-7 we also makes
reference to property values, <span style="font-weight: bold;">properties</span>
are equivalent to variables in NAnt. Here they are being used to define
directory names or project settings. You make references to properties
by using the <font face="Courier New"><i>${property_name}</i></font><i>
syntax</i> (see line 34 for an example). An interesting feature of
properties is that they can be overridden from the command line. For
example, if you wanted to override the <font face="Courier New">dir.build</font>
property, you could use the following:</p>
<div id="codeoutput">&gt;<span>nant </span>-D:dir.nunit=c:\tools\bin
debug</div>
<p>To built this example, we are using the Nant <font
	face="Courier New">&lt;solution&gt;</font> task, which will basically
use the .NET solution file specified and built all its projects and
dependencies. For more flexibility you can execute the individual .NET
compilers (such as the C# compiler using the <font face="Courier">&lt;csc&gt;</font>
task).</p>
<h2>NAnt for Ant users</h2>
<p>If you have used Ant before than NAnt should feel comfortable but
as the NAnt web-site says &quot;NAnt is only compatible with Ant in
spirit&quot;. Some of the differences between the two tools are as
follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Tasks in Nant do not have to be in a target, tasks that appear
	directly in the project are executed in order before any tasks in
	targets are executed.</li>
	<li>The <font face="Courier New">nant.onsuccess </font>and <font
		face="Courier New">nant.onfailure</font> properties can be defined as
	explicit target names in NAnt, these will be executed at the end of the
	build on success or failure.</li>
	<li>NAnt looks for the first file ending in <font face="Courier">.build</font>
	instead of <font face="Courier New">build.xml</font><font
		face="Courier">.</font></li>
	<li>NAnt properties are by default read-write, although they can
	be read-only if desired</li>
	<li>NAnt supports global properties that are defined in a central
	file</li>
	<li>Nant supports embedded scripts that are defined in any .NET
	language</li>
</ul>
<p>There are more differences, these are just the most obvious ones
that you will probably encounter.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This article was intended as a rapid introduction
to some of NAnt's capabilities. NAnt is a powerful but sometimes complex
tool. Fortunately, there are many references, books and articles
describing NAnt, some of these are detailed below.</p>
